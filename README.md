# PSYCHROMETRIC CALCULATOR

A simple interactive CLI psychrometric calculator based on the library from
http://numlog.ca/psychrometrics/psychrometrics.html

This is a legacy project to give Objective-C a try some years ago when I was a Mac
OS X user. It ran successfully on Windows and OS X and is now adopted to Linux.
